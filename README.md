# MAB
The goal of this repository is to provide the code and resources for implementing and evaluating a reinforcement learning approach to optimize network delays using the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model. The repository includes simulation scripts for different network topologies, such as the Tokyo metro network, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the MAB algorithm in minimizing network delays by exploring and exploiting different network paths.
